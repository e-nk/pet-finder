This Project Repository has Two Directories
    1. Frontend
    2. Backend

# Backend

This directory holds the project's backend files. My Backend was developed using RUBY and finally deployed on Render.

The backend is an API that stores data

### API Routes
These are my API routes:

- GET /pets: Get a list of all pets
- POST /pets/create: Create a new pet
- PUT /pets/update/:id: Update an existing pet
- DELETE /pets/destroy/:id: Delete an existing pet
